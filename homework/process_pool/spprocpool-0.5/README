			 spprocpool README

1.Introduction

spprocpool is a Unix/Linux preforked server library written in C++.
Two TCP preforked server frameworks are included. One uses descriptor passing
while the other uses a Leader/Follower. A general-purpose, non-server process
pool is included, and it can been used in a multi-threaded environment.

The spprocpool code was developed under Linux, but has also been tested under Solaris.

You can get the code from the spprocpool home page:

	http://code.google.com/p/spprocpool/

2.Building

To build libspprocpool.so, type

$ make

This will build all the targets include examples. You can run the
example programs:

$ ./testinetserver
This test case is similar to the <Unix Network Programming, V1, Third Ed>
chapter 30.9 TCP Preforked Server, Descriptor Passing
You can run the testinetclient to communicate with this server

testinetserver[17885]: Listen on port [1770]



Reports of successful use of spxml are appreciated.

Enjoy!
